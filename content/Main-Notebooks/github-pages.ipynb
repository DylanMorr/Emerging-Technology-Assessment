    "GitHub pages is a static site hosting service which enables you to host a website. It works by taking HTML, CSS and JavaScript files directly from a repository on GitHub and creates a website after running through these files. Any static file pushed to the repository can be published and personalised static files can be created. GitHub pages do have limitations and prohibitions in place for the sites created and content shared. No private information should be transferred on their sites and other examples include the prohibition of free-web hosting pages for any work area using commercial transactions or the providing of commercial software services. Limitation of usage are also in place. An example of this is that sites sized 1GB or over will not work or publish."

Project sites differ slightly from the other two types as it is connected to, for example JavaScript or another specific project hosted on GitHub. However, this is different to organisation and user sites as they connect to a specific account on GitHub, as opposed to a certain project. These sites created can be publicly viewed and accessed online but organisation sites, if using GitHub Enterprise Cloud, can makes sites private if desired. These different categories of sites all differ in the way they must be published too. Only one user or organisation account can be used for each account. In order to create and publish a user site, a repository belonging to a personal account must be used. For an organisation account, the repository created must belong to an organisation."

Many different types of application servers exist, with some supporting Java and other supporting PHP and even .NET.  Web-based applications can be ran and developed on this type of server. These servers give a centralized approach to updates of applications and as a result of this, data and code integrity can be allowed. Security is provided on these servers as they centralize the authentication process. Also, performance can be enhanced and improved on this server to heavy usage apps as network traffic is limited."

    "A proxy can be a server or a program part of a gateway or another computer separating local networks and outside networks. These servers can be related to both hardware and software and they act as an intermediary between internet web pages and the computer. This means that they provide protection from viruses and hackers. A hardware proxy is a physical proxy server managing all sorts of traffic and this lets the server keep local IP addresses private and safe from hackers. All pages are also cached when retrieved through a network. A software proxy can be downloaded onto a computer and some of these can cost a fee to install as they come from a provider."

    "This computer system provides other computers with data services, for example receiving and obtaining data from a database. Databases can be accessed through either a front-end or a back-end, with the front-end running a machine locally and a back-end using a remote shell to run on the server itself. After retrieving all the data, it can be outputted to whoever requests. Many companies use these database servers for storage purposes."
