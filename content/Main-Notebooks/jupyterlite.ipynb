This distribution runs completely in the browser and it is showing how browser-based interactive computing can be achieved. Its aim is to prove that installing is not necessary in order to gain access to to a lightweight computing world. Clearly JupyterLite works with JupyterLab but it also works with RetroLab. It is easy to access and a website can be constructed using it in a few minutes.\n",
