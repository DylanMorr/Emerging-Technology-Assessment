    "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the quantum-mechanical phenomena. This includes using superposition and entanglement in order to perform operations on data. Quantum computers have the potential to solve problems at a much faster rate than classic computers, especially problems that involve searching through a lot of data or problems that generally require high computational power."
