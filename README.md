# Emerging Technoloy Assessment 2022/2023

This is my assessment work for the Emerging Technoloy module in Software Development in ATU Galway.

## Module Details & Assessment
In the emerging technoloy module we explore topics in computer science that are only 
a couple years old. The main assessment in this module is an open research assessment
with encouragement to explore the topics we learned throughout the semester. For this assessment
we have to setup a GitHub pages site to hold our custom JupyterLite instance, in which we have
our Jupyter Notebooks full of the topics we researched.

## GitHub Pages & JupyterLite
This repository is setup using GitHub Pages. This is a static hosting service provided by GitHub
enabling me to host a JupyterLite instance with all my work and keep it updated using GitHub Actions. 

To see my work, follow the link below and select the Main-Notebooks folder on the left side:
